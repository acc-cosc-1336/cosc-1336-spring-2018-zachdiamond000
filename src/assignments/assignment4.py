    Given a number return its factorial using a for loop.
    A factorial of 5 is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.
    :param number: A number greater than 0
    :return: the factorial of a number
    Using a for loop implement the following, the factorial function should
    work for any number.
    1 * 2 = 2
    2 * 3 = 6
    6 * 4 = 24
    24 * 5 = 120
